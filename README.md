# ChartFinderWeb


Welcome to ChartFinderWeb This SPA is an updated React version of my original CLI portfolio project, and allows you to find music charts for a given date.   

Installation 

Run this line first from the API folder:

bundle install

And then execute:

$ rails s -p 3001 

Then, move to the Client folder:

And then execute:

$ npm start

Usage: Where prompted, enter a date. Click the "Find Chart" button to find the chart from the archives of that particular day, or click "generate birthday playlist" to see the number one on each anniversary of that date.
